# Bíblia Hebraico & Grego – Primeiros Textos + IA

## Overview

This is a fullstack Progressive Web App (PWA) developed in TypeScript using React, Express, and PostgreSQL. It offers a comprehensive biblical reading experience with original Hebrew/Greek texts, Strong's Dictionary integration, and an AI Theological Professor powered by OpenAI GPT-5. The application aims to provide accessible theological study tools, personal annotation features, and offline capabilities, all within an installable PWA for iOS and Android. It includes a subscription model with a free trial to monetize advanced AI features and lifetime Strong's access. The project's ambition is to make in-depth biblical study accessible to a wider audience through modern technology.

## System Architecture

The application is a fullstack PWA with a React frontend and an Express backend, utilizing PostgreSQL for data persistence.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Design System:** Shadcn/UI with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive interface.
- **Theme:** Metallic Blue (`#1A5299`) as the primary color, with full dark mode support.
- **Typography:** Serif font for biblical texts, sans-serif for UI elements.
- **PWA Features:** Complete PWA implementation with manifest, service worker for intelligent caching (enabling offline navigation), optimized icons, and meta tags for native-like installation on iOS and Android.
- **Logo:** A professional logo is integrated throughout the application, including the splash screen and PWA icons.

**Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications:**

- **Authentication:** JWT with bcrypt for secure password hashing.
- **State Management:** TanStack Query v5 for server state management in the frontend.
- **Routing:** Local state-based navigation in the frontend.
- **Bible Data:** Full ACF (Almeida Corrigida Fiel) Bible (31,106 verses, 66 books) is integrated, with an automated import script.
- **Strong's Dictionary:** Complete database of 14,197 entries (5,523 Greek + 8,674 Hebrew) imported from OpenScriptures XML/JS sources into PostgreSQL with optimized indices. **ALL 14,197 entries now have complete Portuguese (Brazilian) translations** in the `portugueseDef` field, achieved through hybrid approach: 2,690 entries extracted from authoritative Portuguese Strong's PDF + 11,507 entries translated via OpenAI GPT-4o-mini. The frontend dynamically fetches Strong's entries via API, mapping 200+ Portuguese words to Strong's numbers via `portugueseToStrong` dictionary. The system intelligently filters short words (< 3 chars) to reduce noise. StrongModal component prioritizes Portuguese definitions with English as supplementary reference.
- **AI Theological Professor:** Integrates OpenAI GPT-5 (via Replit AI Integrations) offering two modes: "Essential" for basic explanations (up to 1024 tokens) and "Premium" for deep exegesis and comparative theology (up to 2048 tokens). AI conversations are saved to a history.
- **User Features:**
    - **Subscriptions:** Manages different subscription plans (`Strong Vitalício`, `IA Essencial`, `IA Premium`).
    - **Trial System:** 30-day free trial for new users providing access to Strong's and AI Essential features, with a visual indicator of remaining trial days.
    - **Bookmarks & Annotations:** Users can create and manage personal bookmarks and notes on verses.

**System Design Choices:**

- **Monorepo Structure:** `server/` for backend, `client/src/` for frontend, `shared/` for shared schemas, and `scripts/` for utilities.
- **Database Schema:**
    - `Users`: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password` (hashed), `trialStartDate`, `createdAt`.
    - `Subscriptions`: `id`, `userId`, `planType`, `status`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `amount`.
    - `Bookmarks`: `id`, `userId`, `book`, `chapter`, `verse`, `color`.
    - `Annotations`: `id`, `userId`, `book`, `chapter`, `verse`, `note`, `updatedAt`.
    - `AIHistory`: `id`, `userId`, `book`, `chapter`, `verse`, `question`, `response`, `aiMode`.
    - `strong_entries`: `strongNumber`, `language`, `lemma`, `translit`, `xlit`, `pron`, `kjvDef`, `strongsDef`, `portugueseDef` (100% populated with Brazilian Portuguese translations), `derivation` with optimized indices. Contains 14,197 entries total, all fully translated.
    - `bible_words`: (prepared for future interlinear data).
- **APIs:** Comprehensive RESTful API endpoints for authentication, subscriptions, permissions, AI interactions, bookmarks, annotations, bible content, and Strong's dictionary lookups.
